# Deep Photoshop 
Deep Photoshop is a tool that helps users to fill missing patches in the image.    
It is currently focussed on removing company logos.

Having ads/ company logos in an image will be annoying.   
Also, will restrict the user to share images publicly as the company can claim copyrights for the same.   

This project is motivated by this idea to remove ads in images automatically using Deep Learning technique.
